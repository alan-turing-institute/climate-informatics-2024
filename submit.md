## Submission guidelines

The subject matter should be selected with Climate Informatics in mind: either presenting algorithms that could have potential applications in geosciences or datasets and physical problems that pose a specific problem in geosciences are both welcome, but ideally should combine machine/deep learning and advanced statistics with a climate-related issue.

This year’s conference offers two tracks for submissions:

**a) Full paper submission**

The accepted full paper will be considered to be included in an open-access, peer-reviewed special collection on the journal [ Environmental Data Science](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science) tied to the conference.

Similar to Environmental Data Science journal, full paper track submission accept the following four types of submission:



* **Application papers**: Research progress, or tackling a real-world problem, in an environmental field, enabled by data science. For example, AI or data science could be used for understanding of climate applications, or improving forecasting tools.
* **Methods papers**: Novel data science methodology inspired by an environmental problem or application. Typically the methodology should be demonstrated in one or more climate applications.
* **Data papers** that describe the development and utility of re-usable environmental data sets to support the advancement of climate informatics research (e.g., benchmarking data sets to support objective evaluation of data sciences methods). The data must reside in publicly accessible repositories. For These papers promote data transparency and data re-use.
* **Position papers**: examples include but are not limited to: a) providing an authoritative, personal view on the uptake or obstacles to AI and data science approaches for environmental problems, or b) exploring issues related to the use of environmental data, including ethical, legal and policy issues, as well as data standards, protocols and services.

The paper should be **no longer than 8 pages, not including references**, using the templates provided by Environmental Data Science (for more information, see the [journal’s instructions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science/information/instructions-for-authors) for authors).



* [Download LaTeX template files](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-file-manager/file/5f84547e1a014c397d6273b7)
* [Download a Word template](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-file-manager/file/608853cd9a02c82ae9dcbf0d)

**b) Extended abstract submission**

No specific template is required for this submission but extended abstract should contain sufficient information for the reviewer to determine the quality of the work. Therefore, submission in this track should include at least these three sections: 



* **Introduction**: describing the motivation and background for the research.
* **Methods**: describing the methods used or developed and data used in this research.
* **Results**: providing a summary of results with sufficient detail for the reviewers to evaluate the merit of the submission.

The extended abstract should be **no longer than 3 pages, not including references**, including figures (not required). You can present preliminary results.

**Open Science Policy**: Climate Informatics community fully embrace the open science momentum and urge all interested authors to follow open science best practices developed by the community (e.g., The Turing Way [Guide for Reproducible Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/reproducible-research)). Additionally, full paper authors should strive to follow the [Cambridge University Press Research Transparency Policy](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science/information/journal-policies/research-transparency) regarding the sharing of data and code.

All submissions should be made through the CMT portal by the deadline of **_2nd February 2024 (Anywhere on Earth [AoE])_**. (**Note for international participants**: Please indicate in the submission system if you will need apply visa to attend the conference in person so the organizers can provide adequate support as soon as possible.)

The papers will be peer-reviewed and decisions about acceptance will be made by xxxxxxxxxx.
