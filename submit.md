# Submissions opening soon !!!

We welcome submission of your research for presentation at CI2024! 
Submissions will be considered for presentation as posters and short talks. Key note presenters will be nominated by the [Organising committee](../team#local-organising-committee) and approved by the [Steering Group](../team#steering-group).

The material submitted should relate directly to Climate Informatics as a topic. 
This can include algorithms with potential application in geosciences, or datasets and physical problems which pose a specific problem in geosciences. 
We particularly welcome submissions applying  machine/deep learning and advanced statistics to a climate-related issue.
