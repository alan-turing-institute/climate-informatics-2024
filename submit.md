  **Emergent sessions** are live discussions among a small group of panel members, mediated by a host. The discussions may cover more advanced topics related to open-science or EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) issues.
</p>
<p align="justify">
During the OSR attendees can hold hybrid emergent sessions. They can request to hold such a session until 3 days prior to the OSR 2023, by creating an issue through our github repo, [template](https://github.com/ohbm/osr2023/issues/1). The OSR team will review these requests and notify everyone of their assigned sessions on July 19th, 5pm.
