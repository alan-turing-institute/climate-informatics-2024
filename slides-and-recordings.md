## Slides
We invite speakers and poster presenters to upload their sides and posters to our [Zenodo Community](https://zenodo.org/communities/climate-informatics/records?q=&l=list&p=1&s=10). See the [Zenodo help guides](https://help.zenodo.org) for more information. 

## Talk recordings
All recorded talks will be shared via the [Turing YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAlanTuringInstituteUK) shortly after the meeting, where presenters have given their permission for this. Stay tuned on the [Turing Environment and Sustainability Slack](../contact#slack) for notifications!
