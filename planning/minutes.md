    - @AnastaseAlex

Going through issues on the GitHub board:
- SH: Let's make sure online experience is a top priority, as much as in person. Can a sub-group of early career reseachers come together in a meeting to see what kind of formats/setups work best. AM: Online social opportunities for engagement/networking (Orlando, Andrew, Lelle, Meghna-- who else?) --check [Gathertown](https://www.gather.town/ for good online experience) -- 
    - ==UPDATE: [issue #13](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024/issues/13) to cover this==
- [Resource for reproducibility review guidelines](https://reproducible-agile.github.io/)

- Tidy up [website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/climate-informatics-2024/)
- LD: Send out 'Save the Date' email to mailing list and forward to colleagues to spread the word
    - ==UPDATE: updated [issue #10]==(https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024/issues/10) to catch all comms points. Assigned Cass, Douglas and Lelle==
- Submissions to January 26, with extention for a week. Mention selection criteria, and that submission will start in the new year
- Alejnadro: online training before conference? Cass: TTW/TPS could support delivery
    - ==UPDATE: added to [issue #15]==(https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024/issues/15)
- It's time to start identifying key speakers for the programme. LD: Send email to build up the list of people in-between us. Spreadsheet to reflect EDI, Douglas will send me. Topics for potential panels, as well.
    - ==UPDATE: added to [issue #8](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024/issues/8). Assigned all==

# Meeting 2023-11-08

## Apologies
- Scott

## Attendees
- Alden
- Cass
- Elisabeth Wadge

## Notes
- CI2024 will be 13th year
- Small (~150) but estabished group, tightnit community.
    - Expect it might grow
- No parrallel sessions
- Last year Scott on steering committee
- This year E&S GC hosting, leverage what we're doing to feed into it 
- Building up reserve and transition for 2025
    - Better representation, better engagement
- Why is this a Turing funded activity?
    - Turing co-branding?
- Need to pin down whether Scott is wearing his Turing hat
    - Make clear that this is a GC activity so it can be justified
- "Sponsorship"?
    - Promoting business?
        - Cost, price and value
    - "Supporting"?
        - Donor doesn't tell us what to do, but their name is listed
    - "Brand aliance and sponsorship - can charge a lot of money for this but you really have to deliver"
- Funding ambitions
    - No clear communication 
    - Opportunity cost - staff time
    - If this becomes a Turing thing - what would that look like over the next 5 things
    - Can go to big people if we have a big plan!
        - Can we make this something bigger that no-one can do? Part of the Turing programme of work.
- Does anyone own it?
    - Not clear, seems very volunteer run and spread.
    - Wouldn't want to take it away form the community
- Would this meeting happen anyway if we weren't doing it? Would Turing want to be doing something like this anyway
    - Would we be providing leadership or conveining power?
- We would be setting up the support for whoever to host next year, in line with our values
    - Would make sense at 150-200k to a donor
- ==Elizabth will send over some questions for Scott== 
    - UPDATE: received and Scott has replied.
- Need to run it through International team
- Position carefully around "fairness" - big donors are interested in that
- Deep Mind should not be approached - stuff happening with Mark G
- "Don't be afraid to think of everything you need"
- Dont need money for April conference, so don't need to have names formilised for Apil
    - Take time to set up the relationships well
