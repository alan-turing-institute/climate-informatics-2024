## Notes

#### Programme
* New addition: Lighting talks for ECRs and students (5min)
* Poster session online, capacity depends on virtual setup
* HiHive
    * Payment on track (some complexities!)
    * We can start buikding virtual space
    * Need Programme Managers signiture as payment won't be finished until after March
    * Capacity 
        * Maximal technical is 2000
        * around 200 is our current expectation 
    * Orlando creating the map space with as many posters we need -==map by next meeting to discuss==
        * [Maps examples](https://hyhyve.notion.site/517e4518406f4011ba21b11fcc3ff2ac?v=db6aaa471d974caa90f9d2b6df956de9)
    * Cass: range and variety/quality are not necessarily the prioririty -more about experience
    * Douglas: maybe not in one timeslot, can we spread the activity across sessions, all posters available throughout
    * Orlando: There is the possibility to have one poster room trhoughout, discussions can be activated during the event time
    * Scott: How to best cluster the activities? And use the opportunity for promotion and online sales boost?
    * Alden: team up by logicistics, time-zones, themed sessions, rooms/days
    * Andrew: Environmental themed based on submissions content? Something more visually appealing than 'color' zones eg green zone


### Optimising online poster scheduliong
- Cosiderations
    - Themeing of content
    - author time zones


### Next steps with programming
- Douglas not to email people to say they've bene accepted - need to confirm programme first
- Want to give some thought to it 
    - talk length, day,..
    - ==Cass and Katy to confirm requirements==
- Prioritise international/visas, 'Turing people' can wait a bit longer
- Full papers will be prioritised as we've been able to get a fuller review
    - received 19 full paper sumbissions
- Need to finalise chairs for the day

### Social plans
- Venue booked for pub quiz
    - Impact hub, in Euston
    - Andrew volunteered
    - Anyone else to join quiz planning team?
        - Alden
        - Cass
        - Bea will be the host!
- Dinner
    - Getting in dietary requirements
    - Seating plan?
        - Mitigation: vegeterian/vegan card
    - DJ? Playlist?
    - Do we have a sponsor for the dinner/drinks reception?
        - Andrew: CUP would be happy to?
        - CUP already doing access fund, so also look elsewhere.

### Sponsorship
- Sponsors need to be Turing approved, or directly pay the venue
- Need to make an ask to Turing partners
- Consider developing relationships at AIUK
- Pull details from last years sponsors, inc contact name/email.
- Douglas can chase amazon contact
- =="Menu" of things that could be covered==
    - Logo (where/when? inc online)
    - Drinks reception
    - access fund
    - Tiered sponsorship
- Start a table of sponsors and contacts
    - [Turing "collaborators"](https://www.turing.ac.uk/partnering-turing/current-partnerships-and-collaborations)
    - Maybe research centres on our university network
    - Aim to pull in two or three!
    - ==Cass pull from our stakeholder map==
    - OpenClimate Fix

==CUP desk at reception==

#### Reproducibility challenge
- Day 2
- One speaker confirmed, more in scope
- 

- 

### Other panels
#### Climate-Health Panel
- Cass suggested panel following up on Turing climate-public health workshop
- Make sure it focuses on the **informatics** part of the challenge
#### Eco impact of research 
- Suggested by Doug? 
- Cass has some speaker links on this topic
    - Please chase if anyone wants to pursue!

### Scriberia or other illustrator?
- Orlando suggests: https://acceleratescience.github.io/assets/uploads/ai-for-science-summit-11-12-december-2023-graphics.pdf
- Katy factored Scriberia into the contingency plan!


Actions Recap: between now and next meeting:
- Programme nail-down

Katy Thompson
Yuhan Douglas Rao
## Apologies: 
Alden
Cass
Scott
Meghna
## Notes
### Review process
89 submissions, 1 keynote proposal, 1 panel discussion on ethics of AI in E&S
(19 full papers, and rest extended abstracts)
43 review in 2 weeks time, possibility of extentions
Notification day could be pushed back by a week (to 1st March)
### Programme planning
#### Panel discussion topics
Any follow-ups on suggested topics?
#### Number of talk slots available & poster event
* Draft [Agenda](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eA27A8xgoZsweGoPkBh1p2C4fCiLNVnhdFKOR4favWE/edit#gid=911939187)
* In-person posters
* Possibility of an online agenda in parallel to harvest the opportunity of the large amount of submissions
### Updates on issues/actions
#### Online platform
Online teem meeting notes in detail [here](https://hackmd.io/egXgvD5rQoKFl1_t7bGJ5w?edit)
* **HyHyve**, meeting 13.02.24
    * Provided demo and [quote](https://8956916.hs-sites.com/dD6IANG7QtraPbCHY0Q0)  €1,569.90 (with 3h onborading and 3h technical support) -monthly subscription, cancel any-time Business Plan
    * Customizable maps, they can provide templates and Orlando could design map
    * Direct broadcasting from venue, or through YouTube live (private link)
    * Live space 24/7 but video minutes are not charged unless broadcasting/videomeeting
    * One-time email verification and GDPR compliant.
* **Topia**, tried to contact
    * Test conference world demo
    * $100/month for 20 users, and $5/month for every additional user in increments of 10 up to 100
    * Comprehensive quidelines for customising worlds

Could someone pay directly for HyHyve? Douglas: Claire said okay to pay for venue, the virtual space falls within it, will copy Lelle in to take it further with CU Boulder.

Orlando: Hybrid poster session to draw engagement to online posters? Douglas: to link into submission stats for which prefer in person and which online. Can it work both ways simultaneously? Probably not at the same time.
Katy: Online conference weeks before the event, with points of interest, some activities, walk-through and meet-n-greet (see her message on Slack)

How does HyHyve work with embedding documents and comments for poster sessions?

#### Reproducibility challenge
[Link to issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024/issues/12)
2 meetings have taken place this year to establish topics, focusing on the full papers.
Checklist in progress
Scoping budget  
Creating more visibility of reproducibility in CI2024, a panel on computational artifacts and assessment with reproducibility people

## Notes

### Partnernships meeting
- How do we use 2024 to springboard 2025?
    - No way to make a surplus this year and hold it for 2025
- Funding availablile in UK gov etc. who sponsor international meetings
    - Alaine (Turing, international) looking into those
- Going to be difficult for Turing to bring in sponsors for 2024
    - one off and low capacity internally
    - Can't have people give money to Turing - need to pay directly to venue etc.
    - ==Lelle/Katy: Ask BMA house to itemize costs==
    - If sponsors are paying things directly, might get round Turing's supplier restrictions?
        - Sponsors may also have their own restrictions...
- ==Adlen/Scott: draft an email for sponsors with a menu of items to choose from==

From Douglas: 
**RE: budget** - I don't think I can see the budget file in the Turing shared drive in the Microsoft system. Claire mentioned that there is 7K USD at CU Boulder that can be used to pay for venues or some other expanses that may offset the cost.
**RE: sponsorship** - if there is a specific policy about what type of sponsorship that Turing can take please let me know. I do have a few contacts at ESA, AWS, and NVIDIA that sponsored past CI events.


### Submission deadline
Extended to Friday 9th February. Currently 9 abstracts submitted and no full paper.

### Tickets

[budget detail here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JPwdKbEEfMrXEWh9CfK-raiEsXO9yuvbuW1zguyPjfU/edit?usp=sharing) contains link to spreadsheet which is internal to Turing only - please let Katy know if you would like to review

- From marketing meeting: we need to adopt access requirements from the Turing (incl. speaker expenses, day care as part of access fund).
    - budgetted into the costs below

Registration opens on 26th February
* 3 days in-person £225.00 
* 3 days in-person (student) £150.00 
* 1 day in-person	 £75.00 
* 1 day in-person (student)	 £55.00 
* Online (unlimited) £25.00 
* Dinner (minus staff, keynotes + access) £75.00 

- ==Need to know VIPs up front i.e. tickets we are giving away==


### Online platform
* Gather Town blocked by Turing - half of the delivery team wouldn't be able to access it and we wouldn't be able to pay for it via Turing
* Gather.town $7/user/month
* [MyHyve](https://www.hyhyve.com/) - Event-based quote for Business plan requested -no response yet. There is also a pay-as-you-go option for 0.03/participant/video minute (+800 video minutes for free) but with less customisable features
    * Orlando has set up one of these.
    * More of an entrance barrier than gathertown
* [Kumospace](https://www.kumospace.com/)  20$/user/month, and US-based (GDPR issues)
* [Topia.io](http://topia.io/) - monthly subscription option only, Pro plan ($100/month for 20 people and additional users $5/user/month)
    * Douglas offered to do a demo
* [Spatial.Chat](https://www.spatial.chat/) $7/user/month in 10-user increments,add-ons: $150 Analytical report, $150/h In-event-support, unlimited stage recording - $500
* *Open source alternative [workadventure]*(https://github.com/workadventure/workadventure)
* Would like for online to be n=200-300
* We could set a cap to keep track of cost
* Priority reminder: how robust the tool is and how it will add value to the user experience. 
* CU Bolder Money could pay
* Form Douglas: Whova has been bothering me all year asking if CI wants to use it for hybrid events - have people used it for other conferences? Andrew: Nifty appp!

## Reproducibility
- After the conference, offer full papers an opt-in to formal computational artefact review
- Would need to build a pool of ~20 reviewers, 
    - Advertise in the conference (potentially a panel session)
    - hold training for reviewers after the conference
        - ECR development opportunity
        - Authorship via CRediT
        - blog-type piece via CUP
- Legacy
    - incorporate into future planning!

## Submission reviewing

- Pannels:
    - [Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Vf6gkvkfuPlLuDWFHi1CHnaCpyTGYRd/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=114601902116252169055&rtpof=true&sd=true)
    - Strong theme on weather forcasting - good to get other directions too
    - Reproducibility: Artifact Evaluation
        - ==Cass/Alejandro: Submit through CMT==
    - Humanities
        - ==Robert: Make sure Ramit has submitted==
    
    - ==Add Guillaume to CMT guillaume.couairon@gmail.com==
    - CMT: "Panel discussion is best suited for emerging topics that are broadly relevant to the community and can benefit from inviting a diverse group (3-5) of practitioners to share their perspectives and provoke broad community discussion. Past panel topics include uncertainty and trust, enhancing the diversity of the community, and reproducibility."
        - Minimally required abstract and speakers
    - Andrew: other panel ideas
        - education x climate informatics (discussion targeted towards bringing climate/weather into CS curricula and vice versa given the high number of faculty and teaching folks attending)
        - edi (think we discussed this in a previous meeting and had a panel on this last year)
        - towards sustainable climate informatics (discussion on the carbon footprint of ML/AI and best practices for more efficient computation in the age of LLMs and LVMs) (especially relevant with Scott’s recent paper, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-023-01369-y)

## Comms
- Andrew to post a daily countdown
- Cass to do a "1 week to go" on Turing mailling lists

* removing need for video submissions of posters in advance
* Submit an image of poster, not video posters
* Poster session advertised as virtual (Gather Town) and in-person
* [Test gather town site set up!:rocket:](https://app.gather.town/app/CWv5cMFdbXnWa7jv/CI%202024%20Teeest)
* Q: time of day for presentations
- Gathertown pricing and availability for one-time reservation
    - $3/user/day
    - whole week == monthly $7/user
    - ==How many people expected online??== (last year 30/40 online)
    - Blocked on Turing wifi
    - ==LD and SH to escalate to Software Review Group==
- Online Posters
    - Gathertown
    - Two platforms for virtual poster
    1. Qiqochat (ESIP has been using it for live demo for the past four years)
    2. Vimeo (AGU is using it next week for virtual poster)
- Note that GatherTown as a technology won't be acceptable to everyone
    - Could generate a zoom link for each poster and list them in a table for easy access
- Need to find ways to encourage online participation, to ma
    - Send onboarding instructions for new users something like [this](https://icaps22.icaps-conference.org/gather)


### Key dates to add to website
* Submission feedback
* Registration open (same day as feedback provided)
* ==Cass add these to website== - done

### Updates on issues/actions
- [Budget Review (sharepoint)](https://thealanturininstitute.sharepoint.com/:x:/s/ee/EWWc-xQKDABArqI5IAg90gUBDazndDN8e434jVk6n_8VHw?e=es7vQe)
    - especially ticket pricing
    - Last year ~£75 student, £150 non-student, Virtual £50 (dinner and reception included)
        - Pricing was determined by cost
    - Formal dinner pushed up the price
    - No one-day tickets offered last year
    - Considder raising the in-person cost (£300 would be and reducing the virtual, both alongside access fund
        - Need to do some sums on numbers once we've finalised speaker numbers (see agenda draft below)
            - Aim to break even on ticket sales - recouping what Turing has already put up front
            - Cover most in-person with some remainder to come from virtual tickets


### Sponsorship
- Alden leading this
- Douglas talking to AWS
- Douglas: Claire still has about $7K at CU that she has offered can be used for the conference. That might be a source for travel support. ==Still in conversation with AWS for ECR Support, and can pursue ESA and Future Earth.==
- Andrew: would be good to get BAS, ECMWF, Met Office, NOC ? Scott: rather unlikely
    - These should be reached by our current mailling lists and slack.

### Agenda
- [Agenda draft planning doc (google drive)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18Vf6gkvkfuPlLuDWFHi1CHnaCpyTGYRd/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100098223339378762434&rtpof=true&sd=true) 
    - ==Douglas will look into it and liaise with Cass & Katy==




### AOB
* ==Any volunteers for reviewing submissions?==
    * Cass (data sets only probably, as less domain expertise)
    * Guillaume 
    * Anastase
    * Orlands
    * Robert

- Accomodation block booking
    - Need to make a block-booking with a Turing contract
        - No viable options within Turing travel expenses caps (FA cup semifinal and london marathon)
        - Block booking of 70 rooms at Holiday Inn at £32k
        - We can book for speakers via Gray Dawes, but suggest that we do not block book for attendees
            - A list of suggested hotels would be acceptable
            - And travel suggestions

# Meeting 2024-01-18
## Attendees
- Christian Fernandez Perotti
- Cass
- Scott
- Katy Thompson
- Marla Fuchs
- Robert Rouse

## Apologies
## Notes
- Present as Cambridge and Turing joining up, to raise support 
- Scott as Chair of 2024 can only make decisions for this year - setting up for next year's Chair

### 2023 sponsors
- Last Sponsorship from:
    - CUP (drinks of poster session - money goes directly to vendor) - they might be interested again
    - Amazon
    - Schmidt Futures
    - [Full sponsors/partners listed in the programme, page 19](https://cambridge-iccs.github.io/climate-informatics-2023/assets/CI2023%20programme%20handbook.pdf)
- "few thousand pounds from each sponsor"

#### 2025 venues
- Where in the Global South
    - ICCS has some centres (?)
    - Latin America is favourable
    - Some networks in Africa
        - Christian and Marla attended WCRP conference (Rwanda - visa restictions are minimal). 
        - Not clear that there is strong engagement / overlap with research areas
        - [African Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://nexteinstein.org)
    - Marla has a lot of Indian contacts

- Investigate a few options and put together proposals for steering group
- Importance of network already being in place - need to have good turn-out from local
- Note Turing has only completed due diligence with India and South Africa

### 2024 considerations
- Suggest that this year's "ask" is part of a package to secure commitment from them for 2025 too. 
- CI has their own budget. Any incoming sponsorship would be held by them
- Sonsors want to back a "specific thing", e
    - Postor session drinks
    - Networking event (potentially off-site)
    - Online presence (GatherTown)
    - Travel for speakers from global south, especially hosts of 2025
- Co-badge a sponsor request template ICCS & Turing
- Schmidt Futures
    - Marla - being a grantee can make the funds transfer lengthy
    - Alden has some connection

- **Note any new sponsors for 2024 will also need to do the Turing Due Diligence Review which is quite lengthy (at least a month in Katy's experience)**

- Criteria for selection
    - Local network
    - Ethical / political stability
    - Transport hub
    - Visa restrictions
    - ==Christian to share his criteria information==
    - Add existing Turing relationships (e.g. existing due diligence analysis)
    - ==Cass work on this together==


- ==Scott: Let CI Steering committee know that we're doing this - get sign off==

- Alden: Need to make the asks for 2024 asap. They might want us to come back seperate for 2025 (different fiscal year)
    - Important to make ground into 2025 sponsorship now, so it does not start too late
    - Make the ask explicit that this will enable participation in the GS, ideally hosting in 2025, but could move to 2026
    - Want 1 donantion now that we can hold on to.

- Turing Partnerships might not want us asking for funding now for the 2025 conference, unless we are hosting it...
    - CI doesn't exist as an entity, so the ask has to come from Turing 
    - Turing could still be the lead for 2025, just the venue host would be in a different country
        - Could make it a strong Turing-ICCS collaboration for 2025
        - De-risks the 2025 if Turing takes lead on it
        - Continuity of leadership in organisation would be valuable
        - Proposa Turing as "convieners" of 2025

- Scott in a meeting with parnerships and Allaine
    - ==Alden to speak with Xander==
    - Maybe Marla/ICCS in early conversations to keep it close 

- ==Alden & Christian draft a proposal (async) and circulate==

- ==Cass make sure Marla and Robert are in CI slack and org group==

- Scott unlikely to be able to attend these conversations, but keep updated.
- Can CI accept money?
    - Would it have to be held in Turing's bank account?
        - ==Alden and Katy to investigate==

# Meeting 2023-11-08

## Apologies
- Scott

## Attendees
- Alden
- Cass
- Elisabeth Wadge

## Notes
- CI2024 will be 13th year
- Small (~150) but estabished group, tightnit community.
    - Expect it might grow
- No parrallel sessions
- Last year Scott on steering committee
- This year E&S GC hosting, leverage what we're doing to feed into it 
- Building up reserve and transition for 2025
    - Better representation, better engagement
- Why is this a Turing funded activity?
    - Turing co-branding?
- Need to pin down whether Scott is wearing his Turing hat
    - Make clear that this is a GC activity so it can be justified
- "Sponsorship"?
    - Promoting business?
        - Cost, price and value
    - "Supporting"?
        - Donor doesn't tell us what to do, but their name is listed
    - "Brand aliance and sponsorship - can charge a lot of money for this but you really have to deliver"
- Funding ambitions
    - No clear communication 
    - Opportunity cost - staff time
    - If this becomes a Turing thing - what would that look like over the next 5 things
    - Can go to big people if we have a big plan!
        - Can we make this something bigger that no-one can do? Part of the Turing programme of work.
- Does anyone own it?
    - Not clear, seems very volunteer run and spread.
    - Wouldn't want to take it away form the community
- Would this meeting happen anyway if we weren't doing it? Would Turing want to be doing something like this anyway
    - Would we be providing leadership or conveining power?
- We would be setting up the support for whoever to host next year, in line with our values
    - Would make sense at 150-200k to a donor
- ==Elizabth will send over some questions for Scott== 
    - UPDATE: received and Scott has replied.
- Need to run it through International team
- Position carefully around "fairness" - big donors are interested in that
- Deep Mind should not be approached - stuff happening with Mark G
- "Don't be afraid to think of everything you need"
- Dont need money for April conference, so don't need to have names formilised for Apil
    - Take time to set up the relationships well
