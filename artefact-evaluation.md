title: Artefact Evaluation
---

All authors of accepted full papers will be invited to submit their research artefacts (software and associated data) for formal review or "artefact evaluation" (AE).

Details of this process are being openly developed on the sister repository for this conference: [climate-informatics-2024-ae](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/climate-informatics-2024-ae).

The AE process will be introduced for authors and potential reviewers during the panel "*Perspectives on Practical Reproducibility in Climate Science*" on [day 2 of the conference](../schedule), and an informal online Q&A session to be scheduled in May 2024. Details of how to register your interest in this session will be circulated via the [Climate Informatics](http://www.climateinformatics.org) and [Turing Environment and Sustainability Grand Challenge](https://cassgvp.kumu.io/alan-turing-institute-environment-and-sustainability) communities.
