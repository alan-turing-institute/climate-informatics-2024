Amy McGovern,,,Professor,,University of Oklahoma,"Amy leads the NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography.  Her research focuses on developing and applying machine learning and data mining methods for real-world applications with a special interest in high-impact weather. Much of her current work focuses on weather analytics or physical data science, where my students and I are developing physics-based trustworthy AI methods as well as explainable AI.  Her lab applies these methods to high-impact weather phenomena including tornadoes, hail, severe wind events, flooding, drought, and aircraft turbulence.",http://meteorology.ou.edu/member/amy-mcgovern/,,
Anima Anandkumar,,,Bren Professor of Computing and Mathematical Sciences,,California Institute of Technology,"Animashree (Anima) Anandkumar is the Bren Professor of Computing at California Institute of Technology. Previously, she was a director of Machine Learning research at NVIDIA. Her research considers tensor-algebraic methods, deep learning and non-convex problems.",http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/,,
David-John Gagne,,,Machine Learning Scientist,,The National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),"David John is a Machine Learning Scientist II and head of the Machine Integration and Learning for Earth Systems group at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. His research focuses on developing machine learning systems to improve the prediction and understanding of high impact weather and to enhance weather and climate models. He received his Ph.D. in meteorology from the University of Oklahoma in 2016 and completed an Advanced Study Program postdoctoral fellowship at NCAR in 2018. He has collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to develop and evaluate machine learning systems for high impact weather and emulation of atmospheric processes. He is a senior leader of the NSF AI Institute on Trustworthy AI for Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography (AI2ES) and senior personnel for the NSF LEAP Science and Technology Center. He has led summer schools, short courses, and hackathons on AI for Earth System Science, chairs the American Meteorological Society Artificial Intelligence Committee, and serves as an editor for the journal AI for the Earth Systems.",https://staff.ucar.edu/users/dgagne,,
IIan Price,,,Research Scientist,,Google DeepMind,"Iilan's DPhil research has focused on sparsity and efficiency in deep learning, and he has have also spent some time working on deep learning for weather forecasting. Beyond these topics he has a broad set of research areas - from AI4science to new model architectures to factuality and attribution in LLMs to applications of Machine Learning for social good. He has a relatively diverse and interdisciplinary background which includes substantial leadership and organisational experience. Prior to the DPhil, he completed an MSc in Mathematical Modelling and Scientific Computing at Oxford, and received an undergraduate degree in Applied Mathematics and Philosophy from the University of Cape Town. Along the way he has also done a few non-research related things like running a social justice oriented youth organization in SA.",https://ilanprice.github.io,,
Peter Dueben,,,Head of Earth System Modelling Section,,European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts,"Peter is the AI and Machine Learning Coordinator at ECMWF and holds a University Research Fellowship of the Royal Society that enables him to perform research towards the use of machine learning, high-performance computing, and reduced numerical precision in weather and climate predictions. Peter has also a strong interest in the quantification of uncertainty of predictions for chaotic systems. Peter is coordinator of the MAELSTROM EuroHPC-Join Undertaking project, work-package leader of the ESiWACE2 H2020 project, and Co-Pi of an US-INCITE grant to perform season-long, global, storm-resolving simulations. Before moving to ECMWF, Peter has written his PhD thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and has worked as PostDoc with Tim Palmer at the University of Oxford.",https://www.ecmwf.int/en/about/who-we-are/staff-profiles/peter-dueben,,
Tamsin Edwards,,,Parliament Thematic Research Lead (Climate & Environment),,King's College London,"Professor Tamsin Edwards is a climate scientist specialising in quantifying the uncertainties of climate model predictions, particularly for the ice sheet and glacier contributions to sea level rise. She was a Lead Author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-group-i/) published in 2021. Tamsin regularly provides expert advice on climate science to the public, policymakers, media and businesses, and is currently the first Parliamentary Thematic Research Lead for Climate & Environment, advising the UK Parliament on research evidence to better inform scrutiny, legislation and debate. She is an award-winning communicator, including through Twitter (flimsin), her blog for the Public Library of Science, PLoS (All Models Are Wrong) (https://allmodels.plos.org) and articles for the Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tamsin-edwards). Tamsin also co-presents the BBC Radio 4 series ""39 Ways to Save the Planet"" (https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000qwt3).",https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/tamsin-edwards,,
