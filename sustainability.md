The Climate Informatics organisers are carefully planning each element of the conference to make sure it is environmentally friendly and socially responsible.



## Sustainable venue

We chose BMA House due to their health and sustainability credentials.

They recognise the importance of sustainability and place environmental best practice at the heart of their offering as a venue, which includes: actively monitoring their footprint; using renewable energy sources; having plastic free, zero-waste philosophy and contributing to the local community.

## Hybrid offering

Travel is the main source of emissions generated during an event.

We selected a venue that is sustainable, as well as centrally located and easily accessible, but we also recognised the need to offer a hybrid option to further reduce carbon emissions. We have developed an engaging online offering to ensure those joining virtually have a similar experience.

## Zero-waste measures

Behind the scenes, the organising team are considering all aspects of our event footprint.

We are being guided by the 4 Rs (in order of importance): refuse, reduce, reuse and recycle. We are seeking to first refuse to produce any wasteful items, and then consider the other options. We're striving for a zero-waste event and hope you can join us!

### How you can help
