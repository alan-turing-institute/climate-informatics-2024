We chose BMA House due to their health and sustainability credentials.

They recognise the importance of sustainability and place environmental best practice at the heart of their offering as a venue, which includes: actively monitoring their footprint; using renewable energy sources; having plastic free, zero-waste philosophy and contributing to the local community.

Travel is the main source of emissions generated during an event.

We selected a venue that is sustainable, as well as centrally located and easily accessible, but we also recognised the need to offer a hybrid option to further reduce carbon emissions. We have developed an engaging online offering to ensure those joining virtually have a similar experience.
