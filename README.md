## Welcome!

This is the GitHub repository for Climate Informatics 2024

This repository hosts the code for [Climate Informatics 2024 website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/climate-informatics-2024/) and project management for delivery of the conference.

Below we provide basic info and links to more information. 

### Who are we?

We are a group of volunteers from the CI community - some who have been contributing to the organisation of this meeting for a number of years, and some who are new! 
We are supported by the operations team of the [Alan Turing Instute Environment and Sustainabilty Grand Challenge](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/environment-and-sustainability), who are hosting the conference. 
See the full list of team members on the [conference website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/climate-informatics-2024/team/).

### What are we doing?

We are organizing the Climate Informatics 2024 meeting (CI2024). 
CI2024 is an intimate conference in a familiar format: keynotes, panel discussions, lightning talks, posters, a dinner, a chance to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. All centered around themes relevant to climate data science. 
We aim to address new and emerging topics, fields and concerns, along with big picture issues in climate data science. 
CI2024 is also a space to meet, connect, work, and collaborate! 
More information is available on the [conference website](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/climate-informatics-2024/)

We are managing this project using a [github project board](https://github.com/orgs/alan-turing-institute/projects/183). 
You are welcome to review the board to keep track of our progress.
