ShortBio: I am a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey as well as a member of the ‘AI for Environmental Risk’ doctoral programme. My thesis focuses on applying novel probabilistic machine learning methods to better understand and predict precipitation over High Mountain Asia. Outside of my doctoral studies, I have developed machine learning models for other environmental applications such as cloud identification and wildfire forecasting. I am also interested in climate policy and bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and decision-making. Before moving to Cambridge in 2019, I completed an integrated master's in Physics at Imperial College London.
