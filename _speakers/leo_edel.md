ShortBio: Leo Edelâ€™s current work focuses on improving sea-ice thickness estimations in an ocean model (called TOPAZ), using a combined approach of artificial intelligence and data assimilation. Improving the estimation of sea-ice thickness can provide crucial information to make better predictions on future sea-ice trends. It can also help mitigate the consequences of sea-ice loss on relevant sectors such as navigation, oil exploration, as well as fishing industries, in addition to the livelihoods of Arctic communities that rely on sea ice.
