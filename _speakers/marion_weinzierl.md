ShortBio: I have a degree (Dipl-Inf.) in Media Informatics from Ulm University, Germany, and a PhD (Dr.rer.nat.) in Scientific Computing from Technische Universitaet Muenchen, Germany. After my PhD, I did a 3-year postdoc in Solar Physics and Space Weather Prediction at Durham University, UK, and then worked as Computational Scientist at a x-ray technology start-up for two years. I then went back to Durham University to work as Research Software Engineer (RSE) in Advanced Research Computing (ARC), and also took on the role as Research Software Engineering Team Lead at the N8 Centre of Excellence for Computationally Intensive Research (N8 CIR), where I led the RSE community and RSE leaders network, chaired the user group of the regional supercomputer Bede, co-lead the Bede support group, and co-founded and co-led the N8 CIR Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC) chapter. After 3.5 years at ARC Durham and 2.5 years at N8 CIR I left both to join the RSE team at the ICCS, University of Cambridge.
