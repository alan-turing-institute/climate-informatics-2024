ShortBio: Hannah Christensen is an Associate Professor in the Physics department at the University of Oxford. She is also a NERC Independent Research Fellow, and holds a Leverhulme Trust Research Leadership Award. She is interested in the role of small-scale atmospheric processes on weather, seasonal, and climate timescales. She uses this understanding to develop parametrisation schemes for weather and climate models (which have been included in atmospheric models around the world). A key theme running throughout Hannahâ€™s research is uncertainty quantification in the context of modelling and prediction. Hannah is increasingly interested in the application of Machine Learning tools to problems in this area. She is on the leadership team of the Oxford Intelligent Earth Centre for Doctoral Training which will train a new generation of PhD students to tackle pressing environmental issues using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
