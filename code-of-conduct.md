### Diversity Statement
<mark>Coming soon</mark>
<!-- The Organization for Human Brain Mapping (OHBM) is an international community of researchers devoted to understanding the structure and function of the human brain, an incredibly complex and diverse entity. As an organization, OHBM strongly values diversity in its membership. OHBM is therefore committed to creating an equitable environment where human diversity is welcomed and respected. While no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honor diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. -->

### Promoting Diversity
<mark>Coming soon</mark>
<!-- In both public and private interactions, OHBM expects its members to be respectful of all community voices. Conversations should be direct, constructive, and positive. We expect members to respect and honor all forms of diversity. Community members are also encouraged to seek diverse perspectives. As an organization, we will work to ensure that our leadership council, symposia and keynote speakers, committee members, and SIGs reflect the diversity of OHBM. -->

### Appreciating Differences
<mark>Coming soon</mark>
<!-- OHBM members come from many cultures and backgrounds. We therefore expect community members to be respectful of different cultural practices, attitudes, and beliefs. This includes being aware of preferred titles and pronouns, as well as using a respectful tone of voice. -->
<!-- While we do not assume OHBM members know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, we expect members to recognize and appreciate differences within our community. This means being open to learning from and educating others, as well as educating yourself. -->
